# IU-CS335
Work from a class I took at IU.

Description:335 will explore how programs written in a high level language are evaluated by a processor to control the physical world. This fall we will be using an entirely new laboratory based upon the STM32 (ARM Cortex-M3) processor and utilizing off-the-shelf modules -- these and many other modules are readily available from on-line suppliers. We will use "C" to write programs to control these modules including an LCD display, a serial interface, a Wii Nunchuk, and an audio amplifier. In the process we will touch topics covered in a number of subsequent CS classes including compilers, operating systems, computer architecture, and digital design. It's obvious that we will be skimming the surface of these topics; for example, we will examine what a compiler and its associated tools (assembler, linker) do in some detail, but not how they are implemented to perform their function. My goal is that at the end of this course every student will be able to explain, in a technically accurate manner, the path from program to I/0 and will be proficient in using one representative set of tools to write programs to control a defined physical world. The progression of experiments introduces embedded system programming, programmed I/O, common protocols including async serial, SPI, and I2C; A/D based sensors, interrupts, and DMA.

Disclaimer: Not all of the code here was written by me.
