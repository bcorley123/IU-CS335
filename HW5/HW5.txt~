1.
 a. There exists 16 register, but we only have access to 13. (R0-R12)
b.  8 registers can be addressed with 16-bit instructions ? (R0-R7)

2.
a. Instructions can either be 16- bit or 32-bit
b. Two-byte alignment restriction.

3. The APSR contains the current state of the condition flags from previous instruction executions. 
 Condition flags are used to exec
N = Negative flag => Set to 1 when the result of the operation was negative, cleared to 0 otherwise.
Z = Zero flag => Set to 1 when the result of the operation was zero, cleared to 0 otherwise.
C = Carry or borrow flag => Set to 1 when the operation resulted in a carry, cleared to 0 otherwise.
V = Overflow flag => Set to 1 when the operation caused overflow, cleared to 0 otherwise
Q = Saturation flag
