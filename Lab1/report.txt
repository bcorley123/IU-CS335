I set up a repository and wrote a C program and pushed it to github.

It took me a lttle while to get the program working because not knowing emacs.

Getting the repository key was a struggle but I searched google and found the answer.

I learned to write a program in C. It's similar to Java so learning it wont be a huge problem.
